        <h3>Delicious ooey gooey fudgy brownies</h3>

        <p>These are some of the most fudgiest brownies that you'll ever have.</p>

        <p>If you're a chocolate lover you're bound to love this chocolaty goodness!</p>

        <p>The only bad thing about this recipe is that they won't last long. They might just be gone as soon as you remove them from the oven. Just make sure you let them cool off a bit first!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>8 oz</em> good-quality chocolate, semi-sweet</li>
            <li><em>12 tablespoons</em> butter, melted</li>
            <li><em>1 &frac14; cups</em> sugar</li>
            <li><em>2</em> eggs</li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoons</em> vanilla extract</li>
            <li><em>&frac34; cup</em> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><em>&frac14;</em> cocoa powder</li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoon</em> salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (180&deg;C). Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
        <!-- used &deg; to put the degree symbol in 350 and 180. -->
            <li>Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second intervals, saving the other half for later.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer, then beat in the eggs and vanilla for 1-2 minutes, until the mixture becomes fluffy and light in color.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or else the eggs will cook), then sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Fold to incorporate the dry ingredients, being careful not to over mix as this will cause the brownies to be more cake-like in texture.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake fot 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your brownies, then cool completely.</li>
            <li>Slice, then serve with a nice cold glass of milk!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
